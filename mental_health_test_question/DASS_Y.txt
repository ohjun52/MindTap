I got upset about little things
I felt dizzy, like I was about to faint
I did not enjoy anything
I had trouble breathing (e.g., fast breathing), even though I wasn't exercising and I was not sick
I hated my life
I found myself over-reacting to situations
My hands felt shaky
I was stressing about lots of things
I felt terrified
There was nothing nice I could look forward to
I was easily irritated
I found it difficult to relax
I could not stop feeling sad
I got annoyed when people interrupted me
I felt like I was about to panic
I hated myself
I felt like I was no good
I was easily annoyed
I could feel my heart beating really fast, even though I hadn't done any hard exercise
I felt scared for no good reason
I felt that life was terrible
